## Reflection Using STAR Technique

**Situation:**
As I approach the final year of my ICT diploma, I recognized the need to begin exploring career opportunities and making professional connections in the technology industry.

**Task:**
My goal was to draft a professional email that would introduce me to potential employers, demonstrate my knowledge of their company, and express my interest in internship opportunities without being overly demanding.

**Action:**
I researched TechInnovate Solutions to understand their recent projects and company values. I structured my email to include a formal greeting, clear introduction, specific compliment about their work, brief overview of my relevant skills, and a polite call to action. I ensured the tone was respectful and professional while showing genuine interest.

**Result:**
This exercise helped me understand the importance of tailored communication in professional settings. I learned how to effectively showcase my skills while demonstrating respect for the recipient's time. The process also improved my ability to research companies and identify alignment between my skills and organizational needs.
