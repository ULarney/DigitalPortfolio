# Mock Interview

## Evidence of Learning

### Mock Interview Recording
[I have completed and recorded a mock interview covering common interview questions and will submit the video file separately as required.]

## Reflection Using STAR Technique

**Situation:**
I participated in a comprehensive mock interview session designed to simulate a real technical interview for a junior developer position. The interview covered both behavioral questions and technical concepts relevant to entry-level ICT roles.

**Task:**
My goal was to demonstrate my technical knowledge, communication skills, and professional demeanor under interview conditions. I aimed to practice articulating my experiences clearly while handling unexpected questions with composure.

**Action:**
I prepared by reviewing common interview questions and practicing my responses using structured methods like STAR and CAR. During the mock interview, I focused on maintaining confident body language, listening carefully to each question, and providing concise yet comprehensive answers. I made sure to include specific examples from my academic projects and highlight relevant technical skills.

**Result:**
The mock interview revealed both strengths and areas for improvement. I received positive feedback on my technical knowledge and project examples, but identified opportunities to improve my conciseness and better tailor my responses to specific job requirements. This experience significantly boosted my confidence and provided practical insights that I can apply in actual job interviews.
