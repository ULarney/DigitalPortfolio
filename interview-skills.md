# Interview Skills

## Evidence of Learning

### Interview Knowledge Assessment

**1. What is the primary purpose of a job interview?**
The primary purpose is a two-way evaluation process where the employer assesses the candidate's qualifications, skills, and cultural fit, while the candidate evaluates whether the role and company align with their career goals and values.

**2. What is the CAR method used for in interviews?**
The CAR method (Challenge-Action-Result) is a structured approach to answering behavioral interview questions. It helps candidates provide specific, evidence-based examples by describing a Challenge they faced, the Actions they took to address it, and the measurable Results of those actions.

**3. What is the purpose of researching a company before an interview?**
Researching a company demonstrates genuine interest, helps tailor answers to show alignment with company values, allows asking informed questions, and shows preparedness. It also helps the candidate determine if the company culture fits their career aspirations.

**4. What is the best way to answer the "Tell me about yourself" question in an interview?**
The best approach is to provide a concise professional summary focusing on current role/relevant education, key accomplishments/skills, and why you're interested in this specific position. It should be a 60-90 second pitch connecting your background to the role you're applying for.

**5. When asked about your greatest weakness in an interview, what is the best approach?**
The best approach is to identify a genuine but manageable weakness, demonstrate self-awareness by explaining how you recognized it, and most importantly, describe the specific steps you're taking to improve. This shows growth mindset and professionalism.
