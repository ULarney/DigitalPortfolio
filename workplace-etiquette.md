# Workplace Etiquette

## Evidence of Learning

### Understanding Professional Standards

**Dress Code Awareness:**
I understand that professional dress codes vary by workplace culture but generally include:
- Business formal: Suits, formal dresses for important meetings/client interactions
- Business casual: Collared shirts, dress pants/skirts, closed-toe shoes for daily office wear
- Smart casual: Neat, presentable clothing that maintains professionalism while being comfortable

**Punctuality and Time Management:**
- Arriving 10-15 minutes early for meetings and work commitments
- Communicating proactively if delayed or facing deadlines
- Respecting others' time by being prepared and concise in communications

**Communication Etiquette:**
- Using appropriate tone and language in emails and meetings
- Active listening without interrupting colleagues
- Providing constructive feedback rather than criticism
- Maintaining professionalism in digital communications (prompt responses, clear subject lines)

**Meeting Protocols:**
- Coming prepared with necessary materials and agenda points
- Participating actively while allowing others to contribute
- Following up on action items and commitments
